<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## ‚úÖ About The Project:

```

The project aims to enhance customer support efficiency by introducing a Quick Replies feature in the helpdesk system.
This will allow agents/user to create, save, and use predefined responses to common queries, accessible via a button or keyboard shortcut.
By selecting quick replies instead of typing manually, agents/users can respond faster and maintain consistent communication, improving productivity and customer satisfaction.

```
