<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## ‚úÖ About The Project:

```

The project aims to enhance customer support efficiency by introducing a Quick Replies feature in the helpdesk system.
This will allow agents/user to create, save, and use predefined responses to common queries, accessible via a button or keyboard shortcut.
By selecting quick replies instead of typing manually, agents/users can respond faster and maintain consistent communication, improving productivity and customer satisfaction.

```

## :rocket: Usage :

üëã Need some help with /quick or /qs?

-   **`/quick`**: Get started with Quick Reply
-   **`/quick create`**: Create a new quick reply
-   **`/quick list`**: List all your quick replies
-   **`/quick config`**: Configure your language preferences and AI settings
-   **`/quick ai`**: Use AI to generate replies
-   **`/quick help`**: Get help with Quick Reply
-   **`/qs <reply name>`**: Quickly search and send a reply by name
-   **`/quick create <name> <message>`**:  Create a quick reply directly from the input box with a name and message

#### Example:
```sh
/quick create greeting Hello! How have you been?
```
This will create a quick reply named **`greeting`**, which can be used later by typing **`/qs greeting`**

### Using Placeholders:

When creating or configuring a reply, you can use placeholders like `[name]`, `[username]`, and `[email]` in the reply content. These placeholders will automatically be replaced based on the recipient's information when the message is sent.
